OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT PROJECT :DATA CLEANING WITH PYSPARK

Objective
To use PySpark for cleaning and preprocessing a large dataset, handling missing values and duplicates, and showcasing the data cleaning process through a Python script or notebook.

Key Components
PySpark Setup: Installing and configuring PySpark.

Data Loading: Loading the dataset into a Spark DataFrame.

Handling Missing Values: Cleaning the dataset by handling or imputing missing values.

Removing Duplicates: Ensuring the dataset contains unique records.

Saving Cleaned Data: Saving the cleaned dataset to a new file.

Steps to Accomplish the Project
Set up PySpark Environment:

Install PySpark using pip: pip install pyspark

Configure your Spark session.

Load the Dataset:

Use PySpark's DataFrame API to load the dataset from a CSV file or any other supported source.

Explore the Dataset:

Display the initial DataFrame to understand the data structure and identify missing values and duplicates.

Handle Missing Values:

Choose a strategy to handle missing values:

Drop rows with missing values: df_cleaned = df.dropna()

Fill missing values with specific values: df_filled = df.fillna({'column1': value1, 'column2': value2})

Remove Duplicates:

Remove duplicate rows: df_no_duplicates = df_cleaned.dropDuplicates()

Save the Cleaned Data:

Save the cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file: df_no_duplicates.write.csv('path/to/cleaned_dataset.csv', header=True)

Document the Process:

Create a Python script or Jupyter notebook to document and showcase the data cleaning process, including code comments and explanations.

Expected Outcomes
Cleaned Dataset: A dataset with no missing values (or properly imputed values) and no duplicates.

Python Script/Notebook: A well-documented script or notebook showcasing the data cleaning process.

Enhanced Data Quality: Improved data quality, ready for further analysis or machine learning tasks.
